 *
 *      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 *      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 *      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

 *
 *      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 *      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 *      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 *      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 *
 *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other 
 *      modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the 
 *      purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 *      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces
 *      of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 *
 *      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 *      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 *      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 *      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright

 *      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

 *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

 *
 *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *      meet the following conditions:
 *
 *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *          stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *          the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *      the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
 *      License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[ ]"

LEGAL NOTICE

This notice is issued to fulfil the requirements of the Mozilla Public License version 1.0 ("MPL 1.0")sections 3.4(a) and 3.6. MPL 1.0 can be 
found at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.0.html. 
Section 3.4(a) of MPL 1.0 states that any third party intellectual property rights in particular functionality or code must be notified in a text file 
named LEGAL that is issued with the source code. Saxon 
includes a number of such third party components, and the relevant claims are included in notices included in the same directory as this 
notice. Although MPL 1.0 requires this notice to be included only with source code, some of the third parties may also require notices to be 
included with executable code. Therefore, Saxon executable code must not be distributed separately from this notice and all the 
accompanying third party notices. The term "Distribution" here includes making the code available for download, and its inclusion in 
download repositories such as Maven.
Section 3.6 of MPL 1.0 states:
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if 
You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a 
description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.
Section 3.2 requires the Source Code of Covered Code to be made  available via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism.
The Source Code version of the Covered Code (that is, the source code of Saxon-B) is available under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 
version 1.0, and may be obtained from the Subversion repository for the Saxon project on SourceForge, at https://sourceforge.net/svn/?
group_id=29872. 
The precise version of the Subversion source for a particular Saxon maintenance release can be determined by referring to the release notes 
for the particular release in the SourceForge download area.
Note that MPL 1.0 requires that any modifications to this source code must be made available under the terms of the MPL "to anyone to 
whom you made an executable version available". As a courtesy, it is also requested that you make such modifications available to Saxonica 
Limited.

2)  http://oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/2001/codepolicy.html "O'Reilly Policy on Re-Use of Code Examples from Books"
O'Reilly Policy on Re-Use of Code Examples from Books
Bruce Epstein, author of Director in a Nutshell (out of print) and Lingo in a Nutshell, who is now working as a part-time editor for O'Reilly (he 

is editor of Colin Moock's recently published ActionScript: The Definitive Guide) sent in the following question:
"What is our policy with regard to programmers incorporating code examples from books into their work? I get asked this all the time."
The short answer is this:
You can use and redistribute example code from our books for any non-commercial purpose (and most commercial purposes) as long as you 
acknowledge their source and authorship. The source of the code should be noted in any documentation as well as in the program code 
itself (as a comment). The attribution should include author, title, publisher, and ISBN.
As is often the case, there's a longer answer as well. Bruce made it really easy for me to put this response together, since he forwarded an 
unofficial reply on this subject that he'd sent to the FlashCoders mailing list. What appears below is based on his message. (Hey, anyone else 
who wants to send the answer as well as the question to Ask Tim can make my job a lot easier :-) Thanks, Bruce.)
As per the copyright notice in our books, O'Reilly reserves all rights to the material in the book, including the code examples. This literally 
means that you can use the example code all you like, but you can't publish or redistribute it without our permission. In reality, we are 
comfortable with any reasonable "fair use" of the code, and you can assume permission is granted without contacting us. The threshold of 
what is reasonable (fair use) depends on a number of factors. First, if the book is published under an open source or open publication license, 
you can use the code examples without any obligation to us. Otherwise, use the following sanity tests:
  1.      If the code is incorporated into a software product, Web site, or Web service, is the product, site, or service a commercial venture? We 
don't object to commercial ventures, but if someone is looking to profit from our work (or that of our authors'), and the use is substantial, we 
may want to consider a license fee. (Send licensing queries to permissions@oreilly.com.)
   2.      Is the O'Reilly material incidental to the entire product? Are you using only a small excerpt? For example, you can't publish a CD-ROM of 
code examples from O'Reilly books without our explicit permission. But we aren't going to worry if you use a routine taken from our books as 
part of a huge software project, in which the borrowed code is incidental.
   3.      Does the work compete with O'Reilly? For example, if you are a book publisher, you can't use anything from our books without our 
permission.
   4.      Is proper credit given? Such credit would include a statement specifying the source of the material, such as "Derived from Example 10-2, 
ActionScript: The Definitive Guide by Colin Moock. Copyright 2001 O'Reilly & Associates." Note that giving credit does not insulate you from 
prosecution if you improperly use copyrighted material!
   5.      Does your use fall within fair use provisions of copyright law? (Academic research, commentary, etc.) For example, you don't need 
O'Reilly's explicit permission to post a snippet of code on a mailing list if you are pointing out a bug, asking a question, or answering one. We 
especially like it when people answer questions by pointing to our books, quoting from them, and citing their examples, as long as they 
acknowledge the source!
      Acknowledging the source is particularly important. Bruce didn't mention this in his posting to FlashCoders, but I know that he personally 
was bit by this one. Someone was routinely answering Lingo questions on a mailing list by supplying examples from Bruce's book, without 
acknowledging the source (and leading people to believe that the poster had written them).
We put the code from our books online because we want it to be used. (Who wants to type it in?) That's why we make it available in lots of 
ways: for download from the Web (all examples are linked from the book's catalog page on oreilly.com), in our CD Bookshelf products, and in 
our new Safari online service.
If you are interested in licensing O'Reilly book content as a third party, send your request to corporate@oreilly.com.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such 
that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, moves information on style sheets, DTDs, and schemas to the 
Copyright FAQ, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the 
ambiguous grant of "use". See the older formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions

("SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS") SHALL SUPPLEMENT AND 

SUPERSEDE THE
MASTER TERMS IN RELATION TO THIS SOFTWARE.

1.	Definitions.

(a)     "Entitlement" means the collective set of 

applicable documents
authorized by Oracle evidencing your obligation to pay associated fees (if
any) for the license, associated Services, and 

the authorized scope of
use of Software under this Agreement.

in this 

Agreement as specified in your Entitlement. The Permitted Use
for any bundled Oracle software not specified in your Entitlement will be
evaluation use as provided in Section 3.

(d)     "Service" means the service(s) that Oracle or its delegate will
provide, if any, as selected in your 

Entitlement and as further
described in the applicable service listings at

under Section 3.

(f)     "You" and "Your" means 

the individual or legal entity specified
in the Entitlement, or for evaluation purposes, the entity performing
the evaluation.

2.      License Grant 

and Entitlement.

Subject to the terms of your Entitlement, Oracle grants you a
nonexclusive, nontransferable limited license to use Software for 

its
Permitted Use for the license term. Your Entitlement will specify (a)
Software licensed, (b) the Permitted Use, (c) the license term, and (d)
the 

Licensed Units.

Additionally, if your Entitlement includes Services, then it will also
specify the (e) Service and (f) service term.

If your rights to 

Software or Services are limited in duration and the
date such rights begin is other than the purchase date, your
Entitlement will provide that 

beginning date(s).

The Entitlement may be delivered to you in various ways depending on
the manner in which you obtain Software and 

Services, for example, the
Entitlement may be provided in your receipt, invoice or your contract
with Oracle or authorized Oracle reseller. It may 

also be in electronic
format if you download Software.

3.      Permitted Use.

As selected in your Entitlement, one or more of the following 

Permitted
Uses will apply to your use of Software. Unless you have an Entitlement
that expressly permits it, you may not use Software for any of 

the
other Permitted Uses. If you don't have an Entitlement, or if your
Entitlement doesn't cover additional software delivered to you, then
such 

software is for your Evaluation Use.

(a) Evaluation Use. You may evaluate Software internally for a period
of 90 days from your first use.

(b) 

Research and Instructional Use. You may use Software internally to
design, develop and test, and also to provide instruction on such
uses.

(c) 

Individual Use. You may use Software internally for personal,
individual use.

(d) Commercial Use. You may use Software internally for your own
commercial purposes.

(e) Service Provider Use. You may make Software functionality
accessible (but not by providing Software itself or through 

outsourcing
services) to your end users in an extranet deployment, but not to your
affiliated companies or to government agencies.

4.      

Licensed Units.

Your Permitted Use is limited to the number of Licensed Units stated in
your Entitlement. If you require additional Licensed 

Units, you will
need additional Entitlement(s).

5.      Restrictions.

(a) The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement are
licensed, 

not sold, to you by Oracle. Oracle reserves all rights not
expressly granted. (b) You may make a single archival copy of Software,
but otherwise 

may not copy, modify, or distribute Software. However if
the Oracle documentation accompanying Software lists specific portions of
Software, 

such as header files, class libraries, reference source code,
and/or redistributable files, that may be handled differently, you may
do so only as 

provided in the Oracle documentation. (c) You may not rent,
lease, lend or encumber Software. (d) Unless enforcement is prohibited
by 

applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software.
(e) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any
Software updates, provided to you at Oracle's discretion, that replace
and/or supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a
separate license. (f) You may not publish or provide the results of any
benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party
without the prior written consent of Oracle. (g) Software is confidential
and copyrighted. (h) Unless otherwise specified, if Software is
delivered 

with embedded or bundled software that enables functionality
of Software, you may not use such software on a stand-alone basis or
use any 

portion of such software to interoperate with any program(s)
other than Software. (i) Software may contain programs that perform
automated 

collection of system data and/or automated software updating
services. System data collected through such programs may be used by
Oracle, 

its subcontractors, and its service delivery partners for the
purpose of providing you with remote system services and/or improving
Oracle's 

software and systems. (j) Software is not designed, licensed or
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any 

nuclear facility and Oracle and its licensors disclaim any express
or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. (k) No right, title or
interest in or to 

any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of
Oracle or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

6.      Java Compatibility and Open 

Source.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except 

under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement
available at www.java.net.

Oracle supports and benefits from the global 

community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions
and open standards-based technology, 

which Oracle has adopted into many of
its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source 

licenses from such communities and third parties that
govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do
not alter any 

rights and obligations you may have under such open
source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions 

in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
this distribution.

7.      Term and Termination.

The license and service term are set forth in your 

Entitlement(s). Your
rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice
from Oracle if you materially breach it or take any 

action in derogation
of Oracle's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Oracle may terminate
this Agreement should any Software become, or 

in Oracle's reasonable
opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual
property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. 

Upon
termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm
compliance in writing to Oracle. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will
survive termination of the Agreement.

8.      Limited Warranty.

Oracle warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
purchase, as 

evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and
workmanship 

under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Oracle's entire liability
under this limited 

warranty will be at Oracle's option to replace Software
media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow
limitations on 

certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply
to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may
have others, which 

vary from state to state.

9.      Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE 

OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10.     

Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ORACLE OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST 

REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
HOWEVER CAUSED 

REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ORACLE 

HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Oracle's
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including 

negligence), or
otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this
Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the 

above
stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not
allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some 

of
the terms above may not be applicable to you.

11.     Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
export, 

re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

12.     U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on 

behalf of the U.S. Government or
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
then the Government's rights in 

Software and accompanying documentation
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 

227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
acquisitions).

13.     Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

14.     Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect 

with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

15.     Integration.

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is
the entire agreement between you and Oracle relating 

to its subject
matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 

prevails
over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating 

to
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
authorized representative of each party.

 #	of or in connection with the use or performance of this software.
 #	
 #	A large portion of the dictionary entries
 #	originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
 #	Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
 #	
 #	Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
 #	original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
 #	that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
 #	on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

 #	
 #	NO WARRANTY
 #	
 #	The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

 #	to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
 #	program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
 #	implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
 #	includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,

 #	any right of any third party.
 #	
 #	Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to

 #	with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 #	or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,

 #	project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
 #	foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
 #	"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
 #	modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 #	production of secondary products from the program.
 #	
 #	In the case where the program, whether in its original form or

3. Time Zone Database
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is 

explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
7.  Database Ownership

   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this

required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed 	
"to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor "

"Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted "	
"against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such "	
warranty or additional liability.

3. Time Zone Database	
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.	
7.  Database Ownership	
	
   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF	
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work	
"   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public"	
"   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply"	
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.	
"   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,"	
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in	
"   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,"	
"   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court"	
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust	
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the	
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that	
   contribution or in the TZ Database.

"    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,"

2.2. Effective Date	
	
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution	
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first	
distributes such Contribution.	
	
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope	
	
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under	
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the	
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.	
"Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a"	
Contributor:	
	
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;	
    or	
	
(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's	
"    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its"	
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor	
    Version); or	
	
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of	
    its Contributions.	
	
"This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,"	
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with	
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).	
	
2.4. Subsequent Licenses	
	
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to	
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this	
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if	
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).	
	
2.5. Representation

Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights	
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.	
	
2.6. Fair Use

"Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted"	
in Section 2.1.	
	
3. Responsibilities	
-------------------	
	
3.1. Distribution of Source Form	
	
"All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any"	
"Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under"	
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source	
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this	
"License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not"	
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code	
Form.	
	
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form	
	
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:	
	
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code	
"    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of"	
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code	
"    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more"	
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and	
	
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this	
"    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the"	
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter	
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.	
	
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work	
	
"You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,"	
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for	
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered	
"Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the"	
"Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this"	
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software	
"under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of"	
"the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered"	
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary	
License(s).	
	
3.4. Notices	
	
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices	
"(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,"	
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of	
"the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to"	
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.	
	
3.5. Application of Additional Terms	
	
"You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,"	
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered	
"Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on"	
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any	
"such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by"	
"You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any"	
"liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,"	
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional	
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any	
jurisdiction.	
	
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation	
---------------------------------------------------	
	
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this	
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to	
"statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with"	
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)	
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must	
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered	
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute	
"or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a"	
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.	
	
5. Termination	
--------------	
	
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically	
"if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become"	
"compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular"	
"Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such"	
"Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an"	
"ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the"	
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have	
"come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular"	
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor	
"notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the"	
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License	
"from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after"	
Your receipt of the notice.	
	
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent	
"infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,"	
"counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version"	
"directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to"	
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section	
2.1 of this License shall terminate.	
	
"5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all"	
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which	
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License	
prior to termination shall survive termination.

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the	
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal	
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring	
cross-claims or counter-claims.	
	
9. Miscellaneous	
----------------	
	
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject	
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be	
"unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent"	
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides	
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter

any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that	
such modified license differs from this License).
